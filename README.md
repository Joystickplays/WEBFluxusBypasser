# WEBFluxusBypasser

Just bypasses the Fluxus Key system. Input your link and it'll spit out a string of characters you can use for your Fluxus Key.
Access it on [here!](https://fluxbypass.goteamstudios.xyz)

This opensource project is solely as a resource to help anyone make their own Fluxus bypassers! However if you don't wanna go through the process of setting it up yourself, you can use the back-end API: `fluxus-bypasser-api.joystick101.repl.co`. If you wanna get a key, simply add `/bypass?hwid=` and then your HWID.
However, I wouldn't recommend it because it's ran at [Replit](https://replit.com/@Joystick101/Fluxus-Bypasser-API) on a free tier so it shuts down in literally like 10 seconds of inactivity, you'd have to wait for it to start back up again.

- My code sucks. If you wanna fix them please.
